On 02/08/2021 at 15:59:12, user `bill[.]cook` from Windows host `desktop-mgvg60z` with MAC address `00:12:79:41:c2:aa` from URL `tonmatdoanminh[.]com`, launched a PHP script called `uninviting[.]php`. This script then uploaded an MS Word document called `0208_54741869750132.doc`. The document was actually a Trojan called `Hanticor, Tordal, or Chanitor`.  
Based on its purpose, `Hanticor` was used as a staging ground to download other malware. For this reason, it turned to `api[.]ipify[.]org` to obtain information about the victim public IP address. After receiving this information, it attempted to connect to C2 servers that were found in it source code. The connection succeeded with `satursed[.]com`. Using cookies, information about the hostname, account, and public IP address is sent to the C2 server at `16:00:10`.  

Next, the Cobalt Strike beacon (file `6Aov`) was downloaded from `hxxp[://]198[.]211[.]10[.]238:8080`, establishing a TLS connection with the Dridex server located at `hxxps[://]198[.]211[.]10[.]238/.`    
Additionally, FickerStealer (file `6lhjgfdghj[.]exe`) was downloaded from `hxxp[://]RoanokeMortgages[.]com` and transmitted files from `%userprofile%\Desktop...\*.txt` to the C2 server at `sweyblidian[.]com - 198[.]211[.]10[.]238:80` at 16:00:18
